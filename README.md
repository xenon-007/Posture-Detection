# Real-Time Posture Monitoring and Productivity Tracking System

This project is a real-time computer vision application designed to monitor user posture using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The system utilizes a webcam or CCTV to track body posture, providing instant visual feedback and on-screen annotations to help users correct their posture. 

## Key Features:
**Real-Time Posture Monitoring**: Leverages advanced computer vision techniques to track user posture in real-time.
**Visual Feedback & Annotations**: Displays visual cues and on-screen annotations to notify users about incorrect posture.
**Posture-Based Productivity Tracking**: Integrates posture tracking with productivity metrics, offering insights into how posture affects productivity levels.
**Health and Productivity**: Aims to improve employee health and productivity in office environments where maintaining good posture is essential for well-being.
**Adaptable for Home Use**: Although primarily designed for offices, the system can be adapted for personal use at home to maintain posture during work-from-home setups.

This tool is ideal for organizations looking to enhance workplace ergonomics and foster healthier work habits or individuals seeking to monitor and improve their posture at home.
